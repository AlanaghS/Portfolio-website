        	<h2> Design Skills</h2>
		    <p> Game design principles focus on the players' experience from start to finish. It lays out how the player will play the game, from its core mechanics to its overall story arc. It's both an art and science of how to gain players' attention and keep them coming back for more.</p>
		    <h2> Digital Editing</h2>
		    <p> Digital editors create, edit, format and publish digital content. They work closely with a team of writers and graphic artists, coordinating their output for online publication. Digital editors work for blogs, websites and traditional media with a digital presence including magazines and newspapers.</p>
		    <h2> Games Design</h2>
		    <p> Video game concept art is all about designing and creating the intended look, style and visual 'feel' of a game before it enters full development. Artists work to sketch out drawings, paintings and references for all the key elements that will appear in the game</p>
		    <h2> Illustrated Graphics</h2>
		    <p> Graphic illustration is art found on flyers, fabrics, book jackets, advertisements, packaging, posters, and websites. It helps express visual ideas, convey messages, sell products, teach students, and promote brands.</p>

		    <h2> Web Authoring</h2>
		    <p> A website development system that allows Web pages to be visually created like a desktop publishing program. A Web authoring program generates the required HTML and JavaScript, and users can switch back and forth between the rendered pages and the code. At a high level, the software is judged by its design tools.
                A web authoring system is software to produce web contents. They range from simple HTML editors to fairly sophisticated integrated development environments. Today, most web contents are not produced with web authoring systems, but with portalware of various kinds (and that include content management systems, wikis, learning management systems. In other words, you don't necessarily need a web authoring tool for producing web contents. The advantage of web sites made with static web contents is that they last (e.g. tecfa.unige.ch has been around since 1994. In addition, they are fast.

		    <h2> 3D Modelling</h2>
		    <p> 3D modelling is the process of creating three-dimensional representations of an object or a surface. 3D models are made within computer-based 3D modelling software, which we'll explore a little later. During the 3D modelling process, you can determine an object's size, shape, and texture.
                The product is called a 3D model, while someone who works with 3D models may be referred to as a 3D artist or a 3D modeler.

                A 3D model can also be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering or used in a computer simulation of physical phenomena.

                3D models may be created automatically or manually. The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. The 3D model can be physically created using 3D printing devices that form 2D layers of the model with three-dimensional material, one layer at a time. Without a 3D model, a 3D print is not possible.

                3D modeling software is a class of 3D computer graphics software used to produce 3D models. Individual programs of this class are called modeling applications
